# Model Weights

Due to file size limitations on GitHub, the trained model weights are not included in this repository.

You can access the files using the following link:

ðŸ”— **[Download Model Weights from Google Drive]([https://your-drive-link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ft0MZjOxWG8Zt0EUBRrK0qGptZHh7rTS?usp=drive_link))**

Once downloaded, place the files in an appropriate local directory (e.g., `weights/`) and update any paths in the notebook accordingly.
